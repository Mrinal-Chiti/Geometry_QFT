# Geometry
From school days we have learned Euclidean geometry. But here we will learn some Differential Geometry. To do this the reader must have some background in the following topics 
1. Elementery Logic and Set Theory ( if you don't know this you can learn it from books or any other notes )
2. Mathematical Maturity ( but this thing cannot be learned from any books or notes ) <br>
Now we start <br>
# Manifolds
Def : Let $X$ be a set. A topology $\tau$ on $X$ is a collection of subsets of $X$, i.e., $\tau \subset \mathcal{P}(X)$, satisfying the following: <br>
    1. $X,\phi \in \tau$ <br>
    2. $\{G_\alpha:\alpha \in \Lambda \} \subset \tau \implies \bigcup_{\alpha \in \Lambda} G_\alpha \in \tau$ <br>
    3. $G_1,G_2,...,G_n \in \tau \implies \bigcap_{j=i}^n G_j \in \tau$ <br>
